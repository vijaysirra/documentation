# About Appranix

[Appranix](http://www.appranix.com/) simplifies and automates application operations on cloud platforms.

The [Appranix documentation](https://app.appranix.net/docs/) provides a great guide to getting started, and the instructions below have more information on integrating with [Codeship Basic](https://codeship.com/features/basic) and [Codeship Pro](https://codeship.com/features/pro).

# Codeship Pro

<h3 id="pro-appranixsh">Appranix.sh</h3>

Integrating Appranix with Codeship requires that you include the  [appranix.sh](https://github.com/RushinthJohn/documentation/blob/master/_data/appranix.sh) script file in your project repository.

Inside this script, you will have the following:

```bash
echo "Installing Appranix CLI"
gem install prana

echo "Setting Appranix URL"
prana config set site=http://app.appranix.net/web -g

echo "Logging into Appranix"
prana auth login --username=${USER} --password=${PASSWORD} --account=${ORG}

echo "Setting Organization as ${SUBORG}"
prana config set organization=${SUBORG}

echo "Setting Assembly as ${ASSEMBLY}"
prana config set assembly=${ASSEMBLY} -g

echo "Updating latest build number"
prana design variable update -a ${ASSEMBLY} --platform=${PLATFORM} appVersion=${CI_BUILD_NUMBER}

echo "Commiting design"
prana design commit design-commit

echo "Pulling design to ${Environment} Environment"
prana configure pull -e ${Environment}

echo "Commiting Environment changes"
prana configure commit environment-commit -e ${Environment}

echo "Starting Environment deployment"
prana transition deployment create -e ${Environment}
```

<h3 id="pro-adding-appranix-credentials">Adding Appranix Credentials</h3>

To start, you need to add the following environment variables to the [encrypted environment variables](https://documentation.codeship.com/pro/builds-and-configuration/environment-variables/) that you encrypt and include in your [codeship-services.yml file](https://documentation.codeship.com/pro/builds-and-configuration/services/).

- `USER` - Username of your Appranix account
- `PASSWORD` - Password of your Appranix account
- `ORG` - Organization in your Appranix account
- `SUBORG` - Sub-organization where assembly is located
- `ASSEMBLY` - Name of the assembly where the Environment is located
- `PLATFORM` - Name of the platform where the artifact component is located
- `ARTIFACT` - Specific name of the artifact component which will deploy the latest build
- `Environment` - Name of the Environment where the artifact component is located

<h3 id="pro-configuring-deployments">Configuring Deployments</h3>

To use Appranix, you will need to call your `appranix.sh` script from your [codeship-steps.yml file](https://documentation.codeship.com/pro/builds-and-configuration/steps/) after the step where your deployment takes place.

```yaml  
- name: Appranix deployment
  tag: master
  service: app
  command: sh appranix.sh
```

Note: The container must have [Ruby version 2.3.3](https://documentation.codeship.com/pro/languages-frameworks/ruby/) or higher for the `appranix.sh` file to execute the required gem install.

# Codeship Basic

<h3 id="basic-appranixsh">Appranix.sh</h3>

Integrating Appranix with Codeship requires that you include the  [appranix.sh](https://github.com/RushinthJohn/documentation/blob/master/_data/appranix.sh) script file in your project repository.

```bash
echo "Setting Ruby Version to Ruby 2.3.3"
rvm use 2.3.3

echo "Installing Appranix CLI"
gem install prana

echo "Setting Appranix URL"
prana config set site=http://app.appranix.net/web -g

echo "Logging into Appranix"
prana auth login --username=${USER} --password=${PASSWORD} --account=${ORG}

echo "Setting Organization as ${SUBORG}"
prana config set organization=${SUBORG}

echo "Setting Assembly as ${ASSEMBLY}"
prana config set assembly=${ASSEMBLY} -g

echo "Updating latest build number"
prana design variable update -a ${ASSEMBLY} --platform=${PLATFORM} appVersion=${CI_BUILD_NUMBER}

echo "Commiting design"
prana design commit design-commit

echo "Pulling design to ${Environment} Environment"
prana configure pull -e ${Environment}

echo "Commiting Environment changes"
prana configure commit environment-commit -e ${Environment}

echo "Starting Environment deployment"
prana transition deployment create -e ${Environment}
```

<h3 id="basic-adding-appranix-credentials">Adding Appranix Credentials</h3>

To start, you need to add the following environment variables to your project's [environment variables](https://documentation.codeship.com/basic/builds-and-configuration/set-environment-variables/).

You can do this by navigating to _Project Settings_ and then clicking on the _Environment_ tab.

- `USER` - Username of your Appranix account
- `PASSWORD` - Password of your Appranix account
- `ORG` - Organization in your Appranix account
- `SUBORG` - Sub-organization where assembly is located
- `ASSEMBLY` - Name of the assembly where the Environment is located
- `PLATFORM` - Name of the platform where the artifact component is located
- `ARTIFACT` - Specific name of the artifact component which will deploy the latest build
- `Environment` - Name of the Environment where the artifact component is located

<h3 id="basic-configuring-deployments">Configuring Deployments</h3>

To use Appranix, you will need to call your `appranix.sh` script from your [deployment pipelines](https://documentation.codeship.com/basic/quickstart/getting-started).

After that add `sh appranix.sh` at the end. The script file will connect to Appranix and trigger deployment for the new build.
