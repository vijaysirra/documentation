# Create Environment

Once the design is committed, we can create an Environment by the following steps

1. Login to Appranix application
2. Click **Assemblies** in the top navbar > **Assembly_name**
3. Click **Environments** button in the Assembly page
4. Click the **New Environment** button in the Environment page
5. Mention the following detail in the New Environment page:
    - Name: Specify a name for the Environment.
    - Environment Group: Select the required [Environment Group](../2-concept.md#environment-group) from the drop-down list
    - Administrative Status: Select the required Administrative Status from the drop-down list
    - Description: A brief description about the Environment
    - DNS Subdomain: Provide a unique DNS Subdomain so that the application once deployed can be accessed correctly as it forms the prefix of the domain name
    - Global DNS: Checking this will create Global DNS names when using multiple clouds
    - Availability Mode: Select the Availability mode whether single or redundant, from the drop-down list
      - Single: The application is deployed in single cloud
      - Redundant: The application is deployed in multiple clouds to overcome the downtime.
    - Clouds: Select the cloud and specify whether it is primary, secondary or not used
6. Click **Save** to create an Environment

Once an Environment is created, the lastly committed design is pulled automatically.
