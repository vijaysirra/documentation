# Commit Design

1. Click **Review** to see your changes, all changes are buffered in a release and are not applied unless you commit.
2. Change attributes of component which are common across all [Environments](../2-concept.md#environment).
3. Add optional components /attachments in design phase.
4. Once satisfied, click **Commit** to commit the changes.

To create an Environment, we need atleast one design to be committed. Only committed design will be used in Environments.
